                    <p>
                        It is not known exactly when coffee as a drink was discovered. However, we do know that the
                        coffee
                        plant originated in Ethiopia, where coffee beans were consumed either as a paste or as a drink,
                        for
                        their medicinal properties. The shrub was introduced to Yemen around the 14th century and it was
                        then that the first coffee plantations were created. Muslim mystics and pilgrims appreciated
                        coffee
                        for its energising powers, so it travelled to Mecca. From that moment onwards, its success
                        became
                        unstoppable, bowling over Cairo, the Middle East and Constantinople, before arriving in Europe
                        in
                        the early 17th century.

                        As expected, this new drink would come up against a few opponents. Religious clerics were
                        suspicious
                        and asked Pope Clement VIII to taste it. He allegedly declared that it would be a sin if only
                        unbelievers were allowed to enjoy such a delicious drink. Like the pope, the privileged classes
                        were
                        charmed by coffee and quickly embraced its exoticism; ’turqueries’ were particularly fashionable
                        at
                        that time. Intellectuals appreciated it for its ability to help one stay alert and to think
                        clearly.

                        Unlike chocolate, which remained a luxury for the privileged for a long time, coffee, which was
                        less-expensive, was adopted by all levels of society and welcomed into homes during the 19th
                        century. A morning cup of coffee gradually replaced traditional broths or soups and became
                        established as a great classic.

                    <h4>Harvesting the Cherries</h4>
                    <p>Depending on the variety, it will take approximately 3 to 4 years for the newly planted coffee
                        trees
                        to bear fruit. The fruit, called the coffee cherry, turns a bright, deep red when it is ripe and
                        ready to be harvested.

                        There is typically one major harvest a year. In countries like Colombia, where there are two
                        flowerings annually, there is a main and secondary crop.

                    <h4>Drying the Beans </h4>
                    <p>If the beans have been processed by the wet method, the pulped and fermented beans must now be
                        dried to approximately 11% moisture to properly prepare them for storage.

                        These beans, still inside the parchment envelope (the endocarp), can be sun-dried by spreading
                        them on drying tables or floors, where they are turned regularly.

                        of the dried cherries.

                        Polishing is an optional process where any silver skin that remains on the beans after hulling
                        is removed by machine.

                        The beans are kept moving throughout the entire process to keep them from burning.

                    <p>The objective of a proper grind is to get the most flavor in a cup of coffee. How coarse or fine
                        the coffee is ground depends on the brewing method.

                        The length of time the grounds will be in contact with water determines the ideal grade of grind
                        Generally, the finer the grind, the more quickly the coffee should be prepared. That’s why
